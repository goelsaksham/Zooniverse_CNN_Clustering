% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:

\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2019} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2019} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
\usepackage{icml2019}[accepted]

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
%\usepackage[accepted]{icml2019}

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:

% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you

% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% ABSTRACT %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
Galaxies are one of the most fundamental entity of the universe. They come in all shapes, sizes and colors and 
in order to understand how the different shapes (or morphologies) of these galaxies relate to the physics that 
create them it is important to group similar galaxies based on their structure. Considering the number of galaxy 
images collected through numerous telescopes this project tries to evaluate the performance of a clustering 
algorithm: "Deep Embedding Clustering" on the Kaggle Galaxy Zoo data. The performance of the algorithm 
is evaluated based on the separation of "Elliptical" and "Spiral" galaxy images into distinct clusters.
