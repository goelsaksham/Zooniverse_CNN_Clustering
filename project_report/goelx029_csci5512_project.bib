    abstract = "{We describe an image analysis supervised learning algorithm that can automatically classify galaxy images. The algorithm is first trained using manually classified images of elliptical, spiral and edge-on galaxies. A large set of image features is extracted from each image, and the most informative features are selected using Fisher scores. Test images can then be classified using a simple Weighted Nearest Neighbour rule such that the Fisher scores are used as the feature weights. Experimental results show that galaxy images from Galaxy Zoo can be classified automatically to spiral, elliptical and edge-on galaxies with an accuracy of ∼90 per cent compared to classifications carried out by the author. Full compilable source code of the algorithm is available for free download, and its general-purpose nature makes it suitable for other uses that involve automatic image analysis of celestial objects.}",

In particular, we explore the application of oblique decision trees induced with different impurity measures to the problem of classifying galactic morphology data provided by Storrie-Lombardi et al. Our results are compared with those obtained by a neural network classifier created by Storrie-Lombardi et al., and we show that the two methodologies are comparable. We conclude with a demonstration that the original data can be easily classified into less well-defined categories.}",

    abstract = "{In this paper we present an experimental study of machine learning and image analysis for performing automated morphological galaxy classification. We used a neural network, and a locally weighted regression method, and implemented homogeneous ensembles of classifiers. The ensemble of neural networks was created using the bagging ensemble method, and manipulation of input features was used to create the ensemble of locally weighed regression. The galaxies used were rotated, centred, and cropped, all in a fully automatic manner. In addition, we used principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and to extract relevant information in the images. Preliminary experimental results using 10-fold cross-validation show that the homogeneous ensemble of locally weighted regression produces the best results, with over 91 per cent accuracy when considering three galaxy types (E, S and Irr), and over 95 per cent accuracy for two types (E and S).}",

The images are reduced and morphological features such as bulge size and the number of arms are extracted, all in a fully automated manner. The galaxy sample was first classified by six independent experts. We use several definitions for the mean type of each galaxy, based on those classifications. We then train and test the network on these features. We find that the rms error of the network classifications, as compared with the mean types of the expert classifications, is 1.8 Revised Hubble Types. This is comparable to the overall rms dispersion between the experts. This result is robust and almost completely independent of the network architecture used.}",
